# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Grafana! :heart:

We love all pull requests, but we cannot merge all of them.
Maintaining a project means that you have to set boundaries.
Even if a specific feature might suit your needs, it might not suite
the majorities need and therefore not worth the maintenance cost.

So start by creating an issue, discussing your improvement before sending a pull request. This way so we can give feedback and directions about the implementations which will save time for both of us.

1. Open an issue to describe your proposed improvement, feature or bug
1. Fork https://github.com/grafana/grafana and clone it
1. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-improvement`)
1. Push your feature branch (`git push origin my-improvement`)
1. Create a Pull Request as appropriate based on the issue discussion
